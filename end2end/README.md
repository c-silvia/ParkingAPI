These end-to-end tests check positive and negative scenarios to ensure the application functions as expected, by sending requests to the endpoints.

To run the tests, first ensure the `parking_app` database has been created, then run the `main.py` file. Finally, while `main.py` is running, run the `test_e2e.py` file.
